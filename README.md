# Dengue Data Analysis: Serotype Distribution in Mexico

This project was undertaken as part of my Data Analyst certification with CoderHouse, completed through a rigorous three-month Bootcamp. The objective was to analyze a dataset focused on dengue fever, specifically examining the distribution of different serotypes across various states in Mexico.

Using Power BI, I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize and interpret the data. The project involved:

- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Processing the dataset to ensure accuracy and relevance.
- Visualization: Creating dynamic charts and maps to illustrate the prevalence and distribution of dengue serotypes.
- Insights: Identifying patterns and trends in the data, providing a clearer understanding of how dengue fever varies by region.

  ## Data Description

The dataset used in this project includes information on dengue fever cases, categorized by serotype and state in Mexico. Key columns in the dataset include:

- `Gender`: Female or Male
- `State`: The state in Mexico where the cases were reported.
- `Serotype`: The specific serotype of dengue fever, based on PCR tests
- `Status`: Confirmation of dengue fever.
- `Type of patiente`: if the patiente needed hospitalization.
- `Institution`: type of clinic or medical institution.
- `Patiente ID`: identification number.
- `Date`: date of actualization.
- `Age`: age of patiente.
- `Date first symptoms`: date of the first symptoms.
- `health conditions`: pre-existing health issues.

## Project Components

- **Power BI Report:** The interactive dashboard created using Power BI.
- **Data Analysis:**
    - Mortality Analysis: Evaluated mortality rates based on dengue fever confirmation and pre-existing health conditions.
    - Serotype Distribution: Analyzed the distribution and proportion of different dengue serotypes across various states.
    - Demographic and Institutional Distribution:
        -Examined the distribution of dengue cases by gender and across different medical institutions.
        -Investigated the prevalence of cases within indigenous populations.
    - Age Distribution and Descriptive Statistics:
        -Analyzed the distribution of cases by age group.
        -Calculated descriptive statistics to summarize the data, including measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
- **Visualizations:** Charts and maps showing the distribution of dengue serotypes across different states.
